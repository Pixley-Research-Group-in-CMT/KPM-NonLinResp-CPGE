# KPM-NonLinResp-CPGE

Physics of the repo:

Model based computation of the circularly polarized photogalvanic effect (CPGE) based in 3D chiral Weyl semimetals using a triple Chebyshev expansion within the KPM approach. Based on a time reversal broken Weyl semimetal, we break the mirror symmetries making it chiral with Weyl nodes at two different places in energy. As a result, the CPGE

becomes quantized for optical frequencies encompassing the Weyl code above the Fermi energy. The dispersion and CPGE in the clean limit showing the quantization is below.
